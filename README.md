# This is the RSE Skills Graph web app written in Python 3 with the Flask framework

To add or update a person's entry modify the JSON entry in people.json. People with spaces in their surname should use underscore e.g. Le_Blanc.
It will be displayed properly with a space. The "interests" for each person need to come from Wikipedia main entries - that is our controlled vocabulary.

requirements.txt should contain the Python modules needed.
You also need to install the C based GraphViz code. On my Mac I did: brew install graphviz

To run locally: python application.py
(where python must be Python 3)

We have this running on Azure now as a Docker container (needed because of mix of Python and C libraries).


Any kind of relationships can be built and displayed using this software.
The JSON is fairly obvious. There are two levels, called "interests" and "technologies", because of the initial use here:
http://supervisors.cs.man.ac.uk.
Interests are clickable, but technologies not. (Some browsers let you right-click a technology and look up its definition.)
In the RSE-skills application we really just use Interests, so everything is clickable. We do use technologies sparingly as commentary.

Portrait images of people can be included in an images directory, but we don't use that faclity in RSE-skills.

## Possible other applications that have been suggested:
- UK wide RSE skills
- Microsoft Student Partner skills


If you want general self-service ability to modify entries, a web front-end would be nice.
For a fairly closed, trusted community you can use Git to let people access and change people.json directly.
